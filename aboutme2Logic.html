    Ethan are having conversations. There are 3 truthtellers and 2 liars. Who's who?</p>

<p>Alice: "Bob is lying."<br>

<div id="Quiz1answer"><details><summary>Explanation</summary>
<p>  Alice and Bob are saying each other is a liar. So Alice and Bob cannot
be both true or both false. That leads Clara a liar. David is a truthteller because
Clara is a liar. We don't know yet whether Ethan is a liar at all. So let's check
 what is his identity.
<p>If he is telling the truth, then Alice is a truthteller and Bob is a liar. And there must be
3 truthtellers(Alice, David, and Ethan) and 2 liars(Bob and Clara).</p>
<p>If he were a liar, then Bob is telling the truth and there would be 2 truthtellers(Bob and David)
and 3 liars(Alice, Clara, Ethan).
<br><br>So Alice, David, and Ethan are the truthtellers and Bob and Clara are the liars. </p></p></details> <img id="Quizpicture"
